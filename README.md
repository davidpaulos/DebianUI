# DebianUI
simplefied pacli(a front end for pacman) for debian's apt-get nothing fancy just something for the basic installing and uninstalling of packages

Many people enjoy aptitude or Synaptic i however found aptitude clunky and Synaptic slow
The apt-get Cli despite being fast it also made me type too much
I loved pacli since the first day i used it but only used a few of its functionality the functionality i remade here for debian's apt-get
This script allows for fast installing and purging of packages, a maintanace option and of course an update function wrapped in a easy t use easy to understand ui

requires: apt-get , fzf and bash

apt-get comes with debian
fzf you will have to compile it yourself

designed for debian system's 

If you want/need more functionality feel free to request it and feel free to post patches i might (depending on amount/length and time) review/test and pull from it
